Insights from the analysis will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. \n\n\n\n## ASK Phase\n\n#### Business Task:\n\nAnalyse usage of smart health devices and identify trends and insight. How might Bellabeat customers’ usages compare to these trends?

A more current data source may be required.\n•\tWith a sample size of just 33, the data is most likely sample-biased, and with no indication of the genders of participants, inferences and insights for our female customers might not be entirely accurate.\n•\tData consists of one summary table: “daily_activity_merged”, and several composite tables. Data on sleep and heart rate patterns are in separate, lone tables. \n•\tData on fat and body weight is incomplete, and supplied by few participants. Elected to omit it from analysis.\n•\tMinute data is a little too detailed for our use.\n\n\n#### Data sources: \n\n“FitBit Fitness Tracker Data.\nPattern recognition with tracker data: : Improve Your

People who do little to no exercise tend to sleep more;\n2. Then, as activity increases, there is a drop in sleep times, probably because these people work longer hours.\n3. Finally, and the actual reason for this analysis, people who do intense exercise tend to have longer (and presumably better) sleep\n\n\n\n## ACT \n\nAfter a comprehensive analysis of the data and trends, the following are the conclusions:\n\n1. The sample size, along with being rather small, does not indicate the genders of the participants. All assumptions made therewith must be further tested and validated for our female clients\n\n2. The shortage of weight and fat data may indicate that participants were reluctant to submit this information, probably due to personal insecurities \n\n3. A majority of the participants seem to lead active, lives. There might be a correlation between that and their use of a smart fitness device, but a control group would be needed to ascertain that\n\n4. In contrast, only a small subset of participants have proper workouts in the mornings\n\n\n### Suggestions for Bellabeat App UX and Marketing\n\n1. According to [this](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/is-your-daily-nap-doing-more-harm-than-good) Havard Health article, daytime naps done right can boost overall health and wellness.\nThe Bellabeat app could introduce a feature where participants can set alarms for a quick nap in the early afternoon.\n\n2. A sleep schedule can improve the quality of sleep and overall moods according to [this](https://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/need-sleep/what-can-you-do/good-sleep-habits) Harvard article.\nThe Bellabeat app could also include a sleep scheduling option, if not already present.\n\n3. Daily exercise prompts could also be added to the app, to get people to do, at least, light workouts in the morning.\n\n4. For marketing campaigns, all three above points could be advertised as part of Bellabeat's USP.\nThere could also be a reward system for number of steps walked weekly or monthly: something like a tiered discount on monthly Bellabeat subscriptions based on reaching a certain number of steps.\n\n5. Since most of the participants seem to be in the working class, adverts should be targeted at this demographic of the general population.\n\n6. Also, for the people who already workout daily, ads could be placed in gyms and other workout hotspots, encouraging people to track their progress. The American Psychological Association, in this [article](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/10/progress-goals) says that frequently monitoring progress toward goals increases the chances of success.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}
